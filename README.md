# What does this template include?

The template is based on Vite, React, TypeScript template, so if you are not familiar with Vite (or have specific needs), generating the base Vite template is better route for you. This template includes Sass plugin and specific Babel configuration. Not that many changes, but that just shows how much Vite already includes by default.

Because of how many features Vite includes by default, I have included some links to aid the configuration if there ever is a need to change some default configurations.
